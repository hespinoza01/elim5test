# Elim5Test

### A test for Fullstack Developer

The application consists of two parts, a client and a server. For the construction of the client, **React** was used together with some complementary libraries, such as **React-router-dom**, **React-Icons** and **Axios**.

For the server, it was built with **Express** and **Sequelize** for the management of the models and communication with the DB.

For the configuration of the environment variables, there is the **.env.local** file which shows the required configurations.

Finally, Heroku was used for the production deployment of the application. Which is available at the following link [elim5test.herokuapp.com](https://elim5test.herokuapp.com/)
